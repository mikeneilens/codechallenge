### challenge28

Use npm install jest to add jest and dependencies.

Function getResult() is app.js and test is in test.js.

This is a copy of the source code for Challenge27 so does more than the requirement specified in Challenge28. E.g. the function accepts a datastore, player and game as well as a list of shots fired. 

//todo
I've not set up package.json for tests as I just tested using right-click/Run jest in vscode.
